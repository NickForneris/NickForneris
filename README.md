Currently I am enjoying working in the React environment and am attempting to<br>
marry it to my passion for all things fincance.<br>
My main project right now involves creating a React app that returns optimal option<br>
strategies from a brokerage API including Iron Condors, Butterflies, Spreads, etc.
